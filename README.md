# 📊  Transport Ridership Forecasting  
A complete end-to-end data analysis and forecasting project using Python, Prophet, and Jupyter Notebook.

This project analyzes multi-year ridership data across several  transport routes, extracts insights, detects anomalies, and produces 7-day ridership forecasts. It includes a full EDA pipeline, forecasting models, visual dashboards, and structured reporting.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies  
- Build 7-day forecasts using Facebook Prophet  
- Generate an automated insights dashboard  
- Export predictions, insights, and reports  
- Provide clear business-ready interpretations

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains daily ridership counts for:

- **Local Route**  
- **Light Rail**  
- **Peak Service**  
- **Rapid Route**  
- **School**

Rows: ~1,900  
Columns: 7  
Time Span: Multiple years

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Weekly Seasonality  
Ridership is consistently higher on weekdays and lower on weekends — especially for School and Peak Service routes.

### 2️⃣ Pandemic Impact (2020–2021)  
A major drop in ridership occurs during COVID-19 lockdown periods.

### 3️⃣ Post-Pandemic Recovery  
After 2022, ridership trends show recovery, especially in Local and Rapid Routes.

### 4️⃣ Route-Specific Patterns  
- **Local & Rapid:** High, stable usage  
- **Peak Service:** Office-hour dependent  
- **School:** Vacation-sensitive with strong dips  
- **Light Rail:** Steady moderate ridership  

### 5️⃣ Seasonal Dips  
Certain months show notable drops due to holidays, festivals, or school vacations.

## 📊 Insights Dashboard  
A 6-panel dashboard summarizes major insights:

- Overall multi-year trend  
- Weekday vs Weekend comparison  
- Monthly seasonality heatmap  
- Pandemic period analysis  
- Sudden drops / anomaly detection  
- Forecast preview  

📁 **Dashboard File:**  
`results/insights_images/dashboard_insights.png`

## 🔮 Forecasting Model  

### Model Used: **Facebook Prophet**  
Prophet is ideal for business time-series because it:  
- Detects daily, weekly, yearly seasonality  
- Handles missing data  
- Adjusts for changing trends  
- Produces confidence intervals  

### Forecasts Generated For:
- Local Route  
- Light Rail  
- Peak Service  
- Rapid Route  
- School  

📁 Forecast Output Files:  
`results/forecast_<route>.csv`

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics  
Metrics used to assess forecasting performance:

- **MAE — Mean Absolute Error**  
- **RMSE — Root Mean Squared Error**  
- **MAPE — Mean Absolute Percentage Error**  

Metric files (if generated) stored in:  
`results/metrics/`

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install prophet pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 2️⃣ Open the Notebook  
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis_and_forecast.ipynb
```

### 3️⃣ Run All Cells  
Executing the notebook will automatically:

- Load and preprocess the dataset  
- Generate all EDA visualizations  
- Build the insights dashboard  
- Train Prophet models  
- Export forecasts, charts, and summaries into the `results/` directory
